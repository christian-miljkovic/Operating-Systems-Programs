A = arrival time
B = input to randomOS function that gives the boundary of the function
C = total CPU time
M = the multiplier to calculate I/O time

I/O Burst = previous CPU time burst * M
CPU Burst = randomOS output

The original input was: 1 (0 1 5 1) 
The (sorted) input is:  1 (0 1 5 1) 

This detailed printout gives the state and remaining burst for each process

Before cycle    0:   unstarted  0.
Before cycle    1:     running  1.
Before cycle    2:     blocked  1.
Before cycle    3:     running  1.
Before cycle    4:     blocked  1.
Before cycle    5:     running  1.
Before cycle    6:     blocked  1.
Before cycle    7:     running  1.
Before cycle    8:     blocked  1.
Before cycle    9:     running  1.



Process 0:
	(A,B,C,M) = (0,1,5,1)
	Finishing time: 9
	Turnaround time: 9 (finishing time - A)
	I/O time: 4 (time in Blocked state)
	Waiting time: 0 (time in Ready state)

Summary Data:
	Finishing time: 9
	CPU Utilization: 0.555556 (percentage of time some job is running)
	I/O Utilization: 0.444444 (percentage of time some job is blocked)
	Throughput: 11.111111 processes per hundred cycles (processes completed per hundred time units)
	Average turnaround time: 9.000000
	Average waiting time: 0.000000
